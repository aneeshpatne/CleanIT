					<p> <strong></strong> Wastewater management is<strong> a process used to remove contaminants from wastewater and convert it into an effluent that can be returned to the</strong> water cycle. Once returned to the water cycle, the effluent creates an acceptable impact on the environment or is reused for various purposes (called water reclamation).</p>

            <h1>Why Manage Wastewater? </h1>
            <p>It's a matter of caring for our environment and for our own health. There are a lot of good reasons why keeping our water clean is an important priority:<br>

              <b>FISHERIES</b>: Clean water is critical to plants and animals that live in water. This is important to the fishing industry, sport fishing enthusiasts, and future generations.<br>
              
              <b>WILDLIFE HABITATS</b>: Our rivers and ocean waters teem with life that depends on shoreline, beaches and marshes. They are critical habitats for hundreds of species of fish and other aquatic life. Migratory water birds use the areas for resting and feeding.<br>
              
              <b>RECREATION AND QUALITY OF LIFE</b>: Water is a great playground  for us all. The scenic and recreational values of our waters are reasons many people choose to live where they do. Visitors are drawn to water activities such as swimming, fishing, boating and picnicking.<br>
              
              <b>HEALTH CONCERNS</b>: If it is not properly cleaned, water can carry disease. Since we live, work and play so close to water, harmful bacteria have to be removed to make water safe.<br>
              
               </p><br>

			<h1>Wastewater Treatment</h1><br>
			<p>
        The major aim of wastewater treatment is to remove as much of the suspended solids as possible before the remaining water, called effluent, is discharged back to the environment. As solid material decays, it uses up oxygen, which is needed by the plants and animals living in the water.<br>

        "Primary treatment" removes about 60 percent of suspended solids from wastewater. This treatment also involves aerating (stirring up) the wastewater, to put oxygen back in. Secondary treatment removes more than 90 percent of suspended solids.</p>

              A.  1 bin for wet waste. Don’t use plastic bin liners. If you can’t get compostable bin liners, use newspaper.<br>
              B.  1 bag for dry Wrap, sharp items like broken glass in newspaper or a box before discarding, or it can cause injury to you, your house help, garbage collectors or rag-pickers.

              <strong><h1>Conclusion:<br></h1></strong><p>
                In summary, the combination of these benefits along with water production makes wastewater Management a sustainable short and long-term solution to the world’s water crisis, which will only increase as the world population increases. It is estimated that the world’s population is set to increase to 9 billion people, and this would cause an increase in the amount of water that can be treated. This will cause the production of large amounts of fresh usable water, thus helping battle water scarcity.
