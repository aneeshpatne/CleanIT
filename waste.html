					<p> A <strong> ground</strong> is, generally, a low-lying,
                         and marshy area, which is located on the outskirts of a city, 
                         where there is, usually, no human population. We have, in Mumbai, 
                         three dumping grounds which are located in the northern part of 
                         Mumbai at Gorai (Borivali), Mulund and Deonar.Amongst the three, 
                         Deonar is the largest dumping ground. All the dumping grounds are 
                         nearly 30-40km from South Mumbai which explains the huge costs on 
                         transportation. The increase in the population of the city has forced
                          people to settle near the dumping grounds. </p>

            <h1>How Much waste is generated in Mumbai ?</h1>
            <p>Mumbai generates waste to the tune of approximately 7,025tonnes per day.<br> The waste consists of:<br>
                • 5,025tonnes of mixed waste (bio-degradable and recyclable)<br>
                • 2,000tonnes of debris and silt.</p><br>


			<h1>Who is Responsible to handle to waste in Mumbai?</h1><br>
			<p>
                The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) is formally responsible 
                for the management of waste in the city. The prevailing approach has been one
                 of collection and disposal that is, garbage is collected from communities by 
                 the municipal authorities and disposed off at the three main dumping sites that
                  are currently servicing the city. Garbage collectors employed by various housing 
                  societies manually collect the waste generated at the household level and dump it 
                  in the garbage bin at specified street corners. There are around 5,800 community bins 
                  in the city. In case of South Mumbai, trucks collect garbage from the garbage bins and
                   transport it to a transfer station which is located in Mahalakshmi.</p>

        <strong><h1>Cause for Concern : </h1></strong><br>
		<p>The average life of a dumping ground is 30 years. The remaining 
            life of our largest dumping ground, i.e., Deonar, is only five to 
            six years and, so far, no alternative site has been found for waste disposal.
             The waste, which offers an incentive after selling like paper, metal, etc.,
              is sold to informal dealers by rag pickers. But the other organic waste, old batteries, 
              polystyrene (thermocol), polythene bags, debris, to name a few, do not have such incentives
               and these are in huge quantities. Also, since it takes a long time to decompose, when dumped, 
               such waste occupies and fills the low-lying areas. In fact, the search for a new dumping ground
                starts only when the filling area of the dumping ground is exhausted. Basically, the lower the 
                waste, the longer the life of the dumping ground and vice versa.<br></p>

                <p>
                    The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched a scheme in August 2019
                     that promised a 15 per cent rebate on property tax if housing societies in Mumbai
                      segregated and processed wet waste in their premises, disposed dry waste and used
                       harvested rainwater and recycled grey water. <br>
                       Bobbili(Andhra Pradesh) is one of the cleanest cities in the world, with a population of
                            0.057 million,The residents at the local level were encouraged to segregate
                             their waste at the source into separate wet and dry waste categories. Bobbili 
                             generates about 70% of organic waste & separates it into two bins. About 88% 
                             of waste segregated by management workers, 
                              kitchen, plastic, and inert waste, in four bins with sufficient capacity is 
                              carried to the SWM Park for recycling.
