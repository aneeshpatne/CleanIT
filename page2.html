					<p> <strong> Waste Segregation</strong> is the process by which waste is separated into different
                         elements. Waste sorting can occur manually at the household and collected
                         through curbside collection schemes, or automatically separated in materials
                         recovery facilities or mechanical biological treatment systems. Hand sorting
                         was the first method used in the history of waste sorting.
                         "Waste segregation" means dividing waste into dry and wet. Dry waste includes
                          wood and related products, metals and glass. Wet waste typically refers to organic 
                          waste usually generated by eating establishments and are heavy in weight due to dampness.</p>

            <h1>How India Treats its Waste: </h1>
            <p>India generates 62 million tonnes (MT) of waste every year, 
                and only 43 MT is collected.  Of the collected waste, close
                 to 31 MT is dumped on landfill sites or water bodies and only11.9 MT
                  is scientifically treated.Consequently, our landfills are brimming with
                   so much urban waste that according to a joint report by Assocham and accounting
                    firm PwC, India is reportedly going to need a landfill that’s the size of New Delhi

                    by 2050.</p><br>

			<h1>Why segregate Waste at Home??</h1><br>
			<p>
                It is essential for us to segregate waste so that we can protect everybody's health. 
                We must not only focus on caring about our health here. If these wastes are segregated
                 properly, then the risk of cuts or bruises that rag pickers and garbage collectors may
                  experience will be avoided. If you are not going to segregate wastes properly, then it 
                  will all mixed up in the landfills just like how they are mixed up in your bin. It would 
                  be fine if they do not contain harmful gas. But, these wastes will decompose and may contaminate 
                  the land. So, it will release leaks and gas that may be harmful to the environment.</p>

              A.  1 bin for wet waste. Don’t use plastic bin liners. If you can’t get compostable bin liners, use newspaper.<br>
              B.  1 bag for dry Wrap, sharp items like broken glass in newspaper or a box before discarding, or it can cause injury to you, your house help, garbage collectors or rag-pickers.

                    You can turn wet waste into compost in less than 30 days by 
                    Mixing nitrogen-rich kitchen waste with carbon-rich materials such as paper, 
                    dry leaves or cocopeat. You could use a large bin or buy a composter. 
                    Commertial Composter start at around ₹1,500.  Smaller ones can be placed
                    in a balcony or window grill.
                      Most composters
                       come with a composting agent, a powder which usually contains cocopeat with 
                       good bacteria and enzymes that speed up the breakdown of the wet waste. 
                       When compost is ready, it looks like soil and has an earthy smell. 
                       If the compost smells bad, it means the nitrogen content is high; simply
                        add more agent or carbon-rich matter to balance it out.
