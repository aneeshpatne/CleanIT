					<p> The 3R Initiative aims to promote the <strong>"3Rs"</strong> (<strong>Reduce, Reuse </strong> and <strong>Recycle</strong>) globally so as to build a sound-material-cycle society through the effective use of resources and materials. It was agreed upon at the G8 Sea Island Summit in June 2004 as a new G8 initiative. In order to formally launch the 3R Initiative, it was also agreed to hold a ministerial meeting in Japan in the spring of 2005.</p>

            <h1>The ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’ Waste Hierarchy </h1>
            <p>If you have heard of something called the “waste hierarchy,” then you may be wondering what that means. It is the order of priority of actions to be taken to reduce the amount of waste generated and to improve overall waste management processes and programs. Commonly called the<strong> “three R’s”</strong> of waste management, this waste hierarchy is the guidance suggested for creating a sustainable life. They are not that hard to implement. All you need is to bring a small <strong>change in your daily lifestyle</strong> to reduce waste so that less amount of it goes to the landfill that can reduce your carbon footprint.</p><br>

			<h1>The First ‘R’ – Reduce</h1><br>
			<p>The concept of reducing what is produced and what is consumed is essential to the waste hierarchy. The logic behind it is simple to understand – if there is less waste, then there is less to recycle or reuse.

				The process of ‘reduce’ begins with an examination of what you are using, and what it is used for.The concept of reducing what is produced and what is consumed is essential to the waste hierarchy. The logic behind it is simple to understand – if there is less waste, then there is less to recycle or reuse.

        <strong><h1>The Second ‘R’ – Reuse </h1></strong><br>
		<p>You may have a box of things you keep that are broken or that you don’t have a use for that you hang on to in-case you find another use for them; or you may find bargains on old furniture or go trash picking and get things that you can refinish – in either case you are working towards reusing the item. Learning to reuse items, or repurpose them for use different from what they are intended for is essential in the waste hierarchy.

			One of the best examples of how this is being done today is the modular construction of homes and office buildings that are being created out of discarded shipping containers.
			
			These large, semi-truck sized metal containers represent a huge waste problem. Repurposing them as homes and offices saves them from landfills and doesn’t require the additional expenditure of natural resources to meltdown and reconfigure the metals used to create them.

				<strong><h1>The Third ‘R’ – Recycling </h1></strong><br>
                <p>
                    The last stage of the waste is to recycle. To recycle something means that it will be transformed again into a raw material that can be shaped into a new item. However, there are very few materials on the earth that cannot be recycled.

One of the issues bothering communities that want to become more involved with a recycling effort is that while the relying collection and sorting process may be affordable to implement, there still has to be a facility to receive and transform the discarded waste into a raw material to produce new products. 

More progress is being made toward uniting recycling plants with industries that can process the waste material through agreements and incentive credits.
