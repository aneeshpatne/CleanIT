					<p> <strong> Composting </strong> is the<strong> natural process of recycling organic matter,</strong> such as leaves and food scraps, into a valuable fertilizer that can enrich soil and plants. Anything that grows decomposes eventually; composting simply speeds up the process by providing an ideal environment for bacteria, fungi, and other decomposing organisms (such as worms, sowbugs, and nematodes) to do their work. The resulting decomposed matter, which often ends up looking like fertile garden soil, is called compost. Fondly referred to by farmers as “black gold,” compost is rich in nutrients and can be used for gardening, horticulture, and agriculture..</p>

            <h1>Benefits of Composting: </h1>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Enriches soil, helping retain moisture and suppress plant diseases and pests.<br>
				<strong>2.</strong> Reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.<br>
					<strong>3.</strong> Encourages the production of beneficial bacteria and fungi that break down organic matter to create humus, a rich nutrient-filled material.<br>
						<strong>4.</strong> Reduces methane emissions from landfills and lowers your carbon footprint.<br>

			<h1>What to compost </h1><br>

<b>1.</b> Fruit scraps,Grass and plant clippings<br>
	<b>2.</b> Vegetable scraps,Dry leaves<br>
		<b>3.</b> Coffee grounds,Eggshells (though they can take a while to break down)<br>

				<b>3.</b> Spray water on the pile regularly so that it remains moist<br>
				<b>4.</b> Turn the compost pile regularly for aeration<br>
				<b>5.</b> Monitor your compost: it is ready if it is dark and crumbly<br>

				<strong><h1>Indoor Composting:<br></h1></strong>
				<p>
                    If you do not have space for an outdoor compost pile, you can compost materials indoors using a special type of bin, which you can buy at a local hardware store, gardening supplies store, or make yourself. Remember to tend your pile and keep track of what you throw in. A properly managed compost bin will not attract pests or rodents and will not smell bad. Your compost should be ready in two to five weeks.
